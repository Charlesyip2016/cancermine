<h3>About</h3>

<p>
	This knowledge base is automatically extracted using text mining tools. We use a supervised learning approach where a set of experts have annotated a large set of sentences to be used as examples for a machine learning system. This machine learning system is <a href="https://github.com/jakelever/kindred">Kindred</a>, a Python package for relation extraction. It is the successor to our <a href="https://github.com/jakelever/VERSE">VERSE system</a> that won part of the <a href="http://2016.bionlp-st.org">BioNLP'16 Shared Task</a> for relation extraction. This machine learning system is then applied to all abstracts in PubMed and all full text papers in the Pubmed Central Open Access subset and Author Manuscript Collections.

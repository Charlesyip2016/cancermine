CancerMine is a literature-mined database of drivers, oncogenes and tumor suppressors in cancer. It is a valuable resource for cancer researchers and clinicians to understand the genetic underpinnings of different cancer types. The largest bottleneck in precision oncology is interpreting the myriad of mutations found in individual patient tumors. Knowledge of the role of those genes in cancer is essential. This resource provides information on genes that are drivers (frequently harbor cancer-promoting mutations), oncogenes (cancer-promoting) and tumor suppressors (protective against cancer) in a large number of different cancers. Context is key as some genes (e.g. NOTCH1) are oncogenes in one cancer and tumor suppressive in another. All data has been text-mined from articles and the source sentence and links are provided.
